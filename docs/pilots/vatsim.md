# VATSIM Network

The VATSIM network is a highly popular online flight simulation network connecting flight enthusiasts across simulators worldwide. While flying on VATSIM representing Jetstar Virtual, members of Jetstar Virtual are expected to follow our VATSIM guidelines.

### UNICOM
Universal Communications, also known as UNICOM, is a frequency utilised by pilots on VATSIM where airspace is uncontrolled. Jetstar Virtual requires all pilots to transmit important intentions over UNICOM. Important intentions might include:

* Pushback
* Taxi
* Departing
* Clear of Runway
* Vectoring to final
* Final approach

!!! info "UNICOM Range"
    The readability of VHF transmissions on UNICOM begins to weaken ~15nm in radius to your position. Generally speaking, pilots more than 30nm away likely won't be able to read your transmission. On the other hand, text UNICOM goes more than 100nm in range, so it's highly recommended to use that for calls made at a high altitude.

### Air Traffic Control Instructions
VATSIM rated air traffic controllers are in a position to give you instructions when in their airspace. Jetstar Virtual expects all pilots to obey with these instructions upon first request; however there are some procedures we apply to ensure operations run smoothly on both ends.

???note "Parking"
    For the sake of realism, we ask pilots to park at the appropriate Jetstar terminals for the airport they're arriving at. You can find more information on the Destinations tab. If given an instruction to park at a non-Jetstar terminal, ask the controller if your desired parking bay is available. **Expect inaccurate parking positions during domestic events**

???note "Speed restrictions below 10,000ft"
    While sometimes required to ensure seperation between departing aircraft, cancelled speed restrictions are sometimes offered by controllers to make your transition to cruise faster. While we understand the gesture, Jetstar Virtual is committed to bringing a realistic flight experience, and so we ask that (if able), these instructions are rejected depending on the nature of the situation. **Expect cancelled speed restrictions in heavy traffic**

???note "Track Shortening"
    If traffic permits, track shortening can be requested by the PiC to allow for a faster overall cruise time. In real life, track shortening is required when an aircraft is running late and wants to arrive on time. Jetstar Virtual asks track shortening is only employed when issued by the air traffic controller without request.

### Going AFK
While flying on VATSIM, air traffic service conditions can change. It's important you're always monitoring online ATC and ensuring you haven't been requested to contact a controller.

Pursuant to the VATSIM Code of Conduct B.B3(a) and B.B3(b), pilots should remain monitoring their flight at all times. If you're required to leave your flight unattended, you must not leave it unattended for more than 30 minutes.

It's your responsibility to ensure you're not in controlled airspace **at all times**.
