# Pilot Reports (PIREPs)

Pilot reports also known as PIREPs, must be filed after each flight completed by a member of Jetstar Virtual. JQV pilots can utilise the smartCARS system to automatically log their flights to the JQV system.

!!!note "What is smartCARS?"
    smartCARS is a downloadable application that tracks flights from beginning to end, keeping tracking of critical information such as takeoff performance, landing rates, and speed control.

A PIREP contains the following information:

* Callsign
* Aircraft
* Departure and Arrival Airport
* Log of events

## PIREP Acceptance Guidelines

One your PIREP has been filed via the smartCARS system, the JQV system will attempt to automatically determine the validity of your pilot report. If it's deemed to be against our guidelines stated below, it'll be sent to our flight operations department and they'll choose to accept or deny the report.

Guidelines apply, such as:

* Landing rate must not exceed -600fpm
* No overspeeds for a duration longer than 2 minutes
* Stalls and slews are not permitted
* Depart and land at correct at the correct airports
* Must complete the flight
* Must not re-fuel whilst airborne

!!!warning "PIREP Notes"
    If you're in a situation where these guidelines **must** be violated, such as a required cancellation of speed restrictions by air traffic control, or diversions (as stated below) - please leave them in your PIREP submission notes on smartCARS. If no reason is given for the violation, the flight operations department will deny the report.

## Diversion Policy

As stated earlier "Depart and land at correct at the correct airports", Jetstar Virtual has a specific policy dedicated to diversions. Diversions may occur for a number of reasons such as but not limited to:

* Air Traffic Control Requirements
* Risk to Aicraft Integrity
* Weather

!!!failure "Medical Diversions"
    Medical diversions are not considered reasonable cause for diversion. PIREPs with such reasoning will be rejected.
